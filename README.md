chromebook arch chroot

so i want an arch chroot on my chromebook and the read only root is annoying me
could just grab the armv7 latest but i can probably blag this on an sd card use it as a dumping point for liveusb network discovery

erm yeh probably not going to amount to much or be a lulz clone of the archiso dir but free remote storage is free 

can probably just dump the entire directory onto git so i dont have to actually do this through a chromebook?

been meaning to setup a raspi as a wake on lan / router / wifi point / bluetooth point / something cheap i can just leave on and abuse 

slightly dont trust the raspi i mean backdooring a stupidly cheap computer to mass sell and ascertain enough networked nodes to attack countries with a much larger
population size and therefore node count totally isnt a viable attack strategy not one bit nope

plan 1... raw image with the rootfs inside persistent perms on clone == fail because 100MB isnt big enough

plan 2... dump everything with stupid perms and never use the repo ever again

plan 3... QQ and generally bitch about everything 

plan 4... cheat split the raw image into multiple files

plan 5... erm argh 

plan 6... cheat everything

fin

this isnt going to make any sense im doing it all on my desktop and testing it on pretty much nothing atm...
