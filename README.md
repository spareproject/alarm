chromebook arch chroot

so i want an arch chroot on my chromebook and the read only root is annoying me
could just grab the armv7 latest but i can probably blag this on an sd card use it as a dumping point for liveusb network discovery

erm yeh probably not going to amount to much or be a lulz clone of the archiso dir but free remote storage is free 

can probably just dump the entire directory onto git so i dont have to actually do this through a chromebook?

been meaning to setup a raspi as a wake on lan / router / wifi point / bluetooth point / something cheap i can just leave on and abuse 

slightly dont trust the raspi i mean backdooring a stupidly cheap computer to mass sell and ascertain enough networked nodes to attack contries with a much larger
population size and therefore node count totally isnt a viable attack strategy not one bit nope
